# FormCalc---Formula-Calculator-Integrator
FormCalc is a symbolic calculator &amp; Integrator that allows users to manipulate real mathe-matical formulae in their textual/symbolic forms.FormCalc is a cross between a standard calculator app on your desktop and the Mathe-matica software package.Main goal of this project is to learn how to represent a complex symbolic formula in a natural OOP fashion, and the necessary methods for converting a flat-string formula into this representation,as well as the necessary methods for generating a corresponding printable/dis-playable flat-string output from these representations.
